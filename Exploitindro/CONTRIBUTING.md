# Contributing

All contributions to InduSploit are not only welcomed, but highly appreciated, please keep in mind the following while making a pull request:

- Each request should make at least one logical change
- All contributions should be forked from the `dev-beta` branch
- Each request will need to be reviewed before merged, if anything seems weird we will either fix it or ask you to fix it for us

  Thank you.
